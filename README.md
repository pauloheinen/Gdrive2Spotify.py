# GDrive to Spotify
## What is this?
#### In a general way, Is a program that uses both Google Drive API and Spotify API. This program searches on Google Drive for audio/mpeg files, it can be ALL data or from a SPECIFIC folder. After, it do WebScrapping and send to Spotify user playlist the music.

## Why?
#### That started as a personal project and a think of "How to send my 400+ music from my Backup Music folder to Spotify without do by myself the whole work for every single file??". So i start a development of a script that in the easiest way, i could have the job done.

## Data Analysis
#### Retrieving ALL audio/mpeg files from my personal Google Drive, those 412 files tooked 28mins to get the file in GDrive, search in a list of Searches Engines, find the Spotify Track ID and push to my test Playlist on Spotify. For all those 412 files, 28 could not be find, that's around 6,8% of fail rate. All the failed items were added automatically into a folder called "Failed-list.txt"
